## **Titanic Survival Analysis**

### **Overview**
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to explore patterns and build a predictive model for survival. Using Python and machine learning techniques, we preprocess the data, visualize important patterns, and develop models to predict survival based on passenger attributes.

---

### **Key Features**
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
  - Handles missing values in critical features such as `Age`, `Cabin`, and `Embarked`.
  - Encodes categorical variables like `Sex` and `Embarked` into numerical values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualizes survival rates based on features like `Sex`, `Pclass`, and `Age`.
  - Identifies key correlations and insights using statistical analysis.
- **Predictive Modeling**:
  - Implements machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for survival prediction.
  - Compares model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### **Setup Instructions**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd titanic-survival-analysis
   ```
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook titanic_survived.ipynb
   ```
4. Run all cells sequentially to view the analysis and results.

### **Insights**
- **Survival Trends**:
  - **Sex**: Females had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males.
  - **Class**: Passengers in `1st Class` had a higher chance of survival than those in `2nd` or `3rd Class`.
  - **Age**: Younger passengers, especially children, were more likely to survive.
- **Cabin Information**:
  - Passengers with known cabin numbers tended to survive more, potentially due to their association with higher-class tickets.
- **Embarkation Point**:
  - Passengers who embarked at `Cherbourg (C)` had better survival rates than those from `Southampton (S)` or `Queenstown (Q)`.

---

### **Solutions**
- **For Historical Research**:
  - Understanding survival patterns can aid historians and researchers in identifying safety issues and societal behaviors during the Titanic tragedy.
- **Data Science Applications**:
  - Demonstrates how machine learning models can predict outcomes based on structured data.
  - Provides a framework for analyzing similar datasets in domains like transportation safety and disaster management.
- **Improving Transportation Safety**:
  - Insights like prioritizing safety for specific demographics (e.g., women and children) can inform modern safety protocols in transportation and evacuation planning.

---

### **Future Enhancements**
- Incorporate advanced algorithms like Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks for improved predictions.
- Use natural language processing (NLP) to analyze textual data (e.g., passenger notes, tickets).
- Perform feature engineering to create new variables, such as family size or ticket price per person.
